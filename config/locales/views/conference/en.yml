          cancelled_description: |
              The activity has been cancelled due to the speaker not being able
              to attend. This is usually out of the control of the organization,
              although these cases will be notified as soon as possible,
              including the reason for cancellation, if possible.

          talk_description: |
              The activity is a talk. One or several speakers share their ideas
              or knowledge about a specific topic.
              Usually, attendees make questions during the talk or approach the
              speaker to solve certain doubts at the end.
          unassigned_description: |
              The activity is missing someone to take care of it. If you believe
              that you are able to deliver the talk or workshop in question, you
              can propose yourself as a speaker. Otherwise, if you know someone
              who is capable of doing so, you may propose them as speaker.
              This is done through the 'Propose speaker' form.
          workshop_description: |
              The activity is a workshop. The aim of workshops is to interact
              with the attendees and that they can try out what is being shown.
              The idea is to have a dynamic and entertaining activity.
